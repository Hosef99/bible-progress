# Bible Progress

Bible Progress is a web application designed to help users keep track of their progress in reading the Bible. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the books and chapters of the Bible, mark chapters as read, and track their overall progress.

## Getting Started
To use Bible Progress, follow the steps below:

1. Access the application by visiting [Bible Progress](https://hosef99.github.io/bible-progress) in your web browser.

2. The main menu will display a list of books from the Bible. Clicking on a book will take you to a page showing all the chapters of that book.

3. On the book's page, click on a chapter to mark it as read. You can always return to the main menu by clicking on the title of the book at the top of the page.

4. To view your progress for each book, click the "Toggle List" button. This will display a list of books along with checkboxes indicating the progress of each chapter. You can mark entire chapters as read or unread using these checkboxes.

5. As you mark chapters as read, Bible Progress will keep track of your progress and update the book list accordingly.
